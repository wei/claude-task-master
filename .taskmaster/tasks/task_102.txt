# Task ID: 102
# Title: Task Master Gateway Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Task Master with premium gateway services for enhanced testing and git workflow capabilities
# Details:
Add gateway integration to Task Master (open source) that enables users to access premium AI-powered test generation, TDD orchestration, and smart git workflows through API key authentication. Maintains local file operations while leveraging remote AI intelligence.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Add gateway integration foundation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create base infrastructure for connecting to premium gateway services
### Details:
Implement configuration management for API keys, endpoint URLs, and feature flags. Create HTTP client wrapper with authentication, error handling, and retry logic.

## 2. Implement test-gen command [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add test generation command that uses gateway API
### Details:
Create command that gathers local context (code, tasks, patterns), sends to gateway API for intelligent test generation, then writes generated tests to local filesystem with proper structure.

## 3. Create TDD workflow command [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement TDD orchestration for red-green-refactor cycle
### Details:
Build TDD state machine that manages test phases, integrates with test watchers, and provides real-time feedback during development cycles.

## 4. Add git-flow command [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement automated git workflow with smart commits
### Details:
Create git workflow automation including branch management, smart commit message generation via gateway API, and PR creation with comprehensive descriptions.

## 5. Enhance task structure for testing metadata [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Extend task schema to support test and git information
### Details:
Add fields for test files, coverage data, git branches, commit history, and TDD phase tracking to task structure.

## 6. Add MCP tools for test-gen and TDD commands [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create MCP tool interfaces for IDE integration
### Details:
Implement MCP tools that expose test generation and TDD workflow commands to IDEs like Cursor, enabling seamless integration with development environment.

## 7. Create test pattern detection for existing codebase [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze existing tests to learn project patterns
### Details:
Implement pattern detection that analyzes existing test files to understand project conventions, naming patterns, and testing approaches for consistency.

## 8. Add coverage analysis integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate with coverage tools and provide insights
### Details:
Connect with Jest, NYC, and other coverage tools to analyze test coverage, identify gaps, and suggest improvements through gateway API.

## 9. Implement test watcher with phase transitions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create intelligent test watcher for TDD automation
### Details:
Build test watcher that monitors test results and automatically transitions between TDD phases (red/green/refactor) based on test outcomes.

## 10. Add fallback mode when gateway is unavailable [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure Task Master works without gateway access
### Details:
Implement graceful degradation when gateway API is unavailable, falling back to local AI models or basic functionality while maintaining core Task Master features.
