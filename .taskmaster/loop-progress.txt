# Loop Feature Progress

## 2026-01-08
- 1.1: Created loop module directory and types.ts. All types already implemented: LoopPreset, LoopConfig, LoopIteration, LoopResult, LoopCompletionMarker. index.ts barrel export also present.
- 1.2: Added types.spec.ts with compile-time type tests. LoopPreset/LoopConfig were already in types.ts from 1.1. tsc --noEmit passes. Native rollup module issue in env blocked vitest but types are correct.
- 1.3: LoopIteration and LoopResult interfaces already defined in types.ts (lines 38-63) from 1.1. Tests present in types.spec.ts (lines 69-129). tsc --noEmit passes. Marked done.
- 1.4: LoopCompletionMarker already defined in types.ts (lines 65-73) from 1.1. Tests in types.spec.ts (lines 131-149). tsc --noEmit passes. Marked done.
